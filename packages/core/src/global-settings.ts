/**
 * Global settings store — manages user-level settings in `~/.pi/fusion/settings.json`.
 *
 * Global settings persist across all fn projects for the current user.
 * They include UI theme preferences, default AI model selection, and
 * notification configuration.
 *
 * **Schema protection**: The store preserves any keys found in the settings
 * file that are not part of the current `GlobalSettings` schema. This prevents
 * data loss when schema changes remove fields — the values remain on disk and
 * can be restored if the field is re-added later. See `readRaw()`.
 *
 * @see {@link GlobalSettings} for the full list of global fields.
