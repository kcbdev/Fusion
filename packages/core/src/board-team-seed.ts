/**
 * Board-team seeding (company-model U2, R8).
 *
 * Flag-gated step (`experimentalFeatures.companyModel`) that auto-creates the
 * durable named agents the company model relies on:
 *  - one project-level **CEO** (the global-chat router), and
 *  - per-board **Lead / Executor / Reviewer** staffed onto the board's three
 *    mandatory role columns (todo / in-progress / in-review) via
 *    {@link WorkflowColumnAgent} bindings in mode `"defer"` — so an advanced
 *    per-task agent/model override still wins (KTD column-agent precedence).
 *
 * Two entry points share one idempotent core:
 *  - {@link seedBoardTeam} — call at project registration (seeds CEO + every
 *    existing board) and as a startup backfill for projects created flag-off;
 *  - {@link seedBoardTeamForBoard} — call at board creation (seeds just that
 *    board's Lead/Executor/Reviewer).
 *
 * Idempotency (per `docs/solutions/logic-errors/branch-group-name-collision-strands-mission-triage.md`):
 * seeded agents carry stable identity in `metadata.companyRole` (+ `metadata.boardId`
 * for per-board roles), so re-running never duplicates. Display names are derived
 * from the board name but are NOT the identity key, so a board rename does not
 * orphan or re-create the team. A same-named USER agent that lacks the role marker
 * is adopted/promoted when it already has the matching role capability, else the
 * seed picks a disambiguated name — it is never blindly inserted on top of a
 * collision and never strands a binding to a non-existent agent.
 *
 * Permission policies are NEVER the unrestricted default (KTD): the CEO gets a
 * task-routing-only policy; Lead and Reviewer get policies that block command
 * execution (and git writes — spec/review work needs no shell); the Executor
 * carries the project's normal execution policy (`permissionPolicy` left unset
 * so it resolves to the project default).
