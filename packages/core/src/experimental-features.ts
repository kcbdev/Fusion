FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-26-09:00:
Post-merge workflow steps run GRAPH-NATIVE behind this default-OFF experimental flag
(U7 spike). When OFF (the default — the key is absent from DEFAULT_*_SETTINGS so
`isExperimentalFeatureEnabled` returns false), the merge-region stays collapsed exactly
as before: the graph routes merge-attempt success straight to `end` and the merger still
owns post-merge steps from the legacy table — zero behavior change, byte-identical
builtin:coding traversal. When ON, the graph executor lets traversal continue past a
SUCCESSFUL merge to any post-merge optional-group node reachable from the merge region,
running it via the same optional-group execution+recording path (phase:"post-merge",
non-blocking failures). This unit is additive + reversible: a later unit removes the
legacy merger post-merge path. Mirrors the WORKFLOW_INTERPRETER_DUAL_OBSERVE_FLAG read
plumbing (named constant + `isExperimentalFeatureEnabled`).
