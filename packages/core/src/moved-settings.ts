/**
 * Tombstone allowlist for the U4 hard-move (KTD-5).
 *
 * `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS` is the single, authoritative record of the settings keys
 * that left `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS` and now live exclusively as **workflow
 * setting values** per `(workflowId, projectId)`. It is derived directly from the
 * moved workflow declaration catalog (`BUILTIN_MOVED_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS`) so the move
 * has exactly one source of truth. Workflow-native declarations (for example
 * triage policy thresholds) are deliberately excluded from this tombstone.
 * Adding/removing a key from the moved catalog automatically reflows the
 * tombstone list, the migration write target, and the stale-writer guard.
 *
 * What the tombstone shields (KTD-5, R8):
 *   - the project/global settings WRITE paths (`updateSettings` /
 *     `updateGlobalSettings`) — incoming moved keys from stale writers are silently
 *     dropped, never persisted (they would otherwise re-materialize in raw
 *     storage and, via the default re-injection trap, silently override the
 *     migrated workflow value);
 *   - the migration's raw-key null-out (it nulls exactly these keys from the
 *     persisted project + global stores);
 *   - (in U5) settings export v2 / cross-node sync diff / v1 import.
 *
 * ── TYPE-vs-SCHEMA SPLIT (deliberate, documented per the U4 plan) ──────────────
 * The moved keys are REMOVED from `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS` (so they vanish from
 * `PROJECT_SETTINGS_KEYS` / `isProjectSettingsKey` / the save-split), but the
 * corresponding fields are RETAINED on the `ProjectSettings` / `Settings`
 * TypeScript interfaces. This is intentional: the engine still types its ~20 flat
 * `settings.<movedKey>` read sites and the U3 effective-settings merge off
 * `Partial<Settings>`, so dropping the fields from the type would break those
 * call sites. The schema MEMBERSHIP (key lists / predicates / persistence
 * filters) is the thing that must not include moved keys — not the type shape.
 *
 * NOTE on `buildTimeoutMs`: it has NO reader anywhere in the engine, so it fails
 * the per-task-reader rule (KTD-5 / catalog-shrink) and was removed from
 * `BUILTIN_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS` entirely. It therefore stays a plain project
 * setting and is intentionally ABSENT from this list.
