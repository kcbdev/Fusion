/**
 * Company-model board column template (U3, R1/R2/R5/R6).
 *
 * The opinionated default workflow for a flag-on company board. It is a v2 IR
 * preset built over the SAME trait registry as the legacy default workflow, so
 * R6 (non-coding boards reach done with no merge machinery) falls out of column
 * config rather than new engine code.
 *
 * Differences from {@link BUILTIN_CODING_WORKFLOW_IR}:
 *  - NO `triage` column — the Lead absorbs triage's spec work on Todo entry
 *    (U5), so the company board's working entry column is `todo` directly.
 *  - An unstaffed, locked `idea` intake column sits BEFORE `todo` (R5/KTD):
 *    user-created tasks land there; CEO-routed tasks land in Todo. The idea
 *    column carries the `intake` trait, has no `role` marker (it is never a
 *    mandatory-role-staffing column, so U2's staffing validation ignores it) and
 *    is never picked up by the Lead triage scan / dispatch (those gate on the
 *    todo column id specifically).
 *  - The three role columns (todo / in-progress / in-review) carry company-model
 *    markers: `role` ("lead" | "executor" | "reviewer") and `locked: true`.
 *    These markers are the carrier the placement/movement rules key off
 *    (workflow-reconciliation, workflow-transitions): a board whose IR carries
 *    them is a company-model board; one that doesn't stays on the legacy path.
 *    Legacy/default workflows never set them, so flag-off behavior is byte-
 *    identical.
 *
 * Single variant: every company board keeps the full merge machinery (R6) — a
 * non-coding board differs only by agent instructions (no code enforces that), so
 * there is no merge-less column variant.
 *
 * Trait mapping mirrors the legacy semantics for the columns that exist:
 *   idea        = intake
 *   todo        = hold(capacity) + reset-on-entry
 *   in-progress = wip + abort-on-exit + timing
 *   in-review   = merge-blocker + stall-detection + merge
 *   done        = complete
 *   archived    = archived
 *
 * The graph (nodes/edges) reuses the coding pipeline's execute → review → merge
 * walk (the `idea` column is intake-only and carries no automation node).
