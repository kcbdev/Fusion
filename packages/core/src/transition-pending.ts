/**

 * returns a statement with `.get`/`.run`) so they can be unit-tested against a
 * raw {@link import("./db.js").Database} without dragging in `store.ts`. U4 owns
 * wiring these into `moveTaskInternal`'s transaction and the recovery sweep;
 * this module is the clean seam they will call.
 *
 * The marker is written in the same transaction as the column change (KTD-2) and
 * cleared once post-commit hooks complete. Recovery reads it back exclusively
 * from SQLite (the authoritative store per ADR-0001).
