/*
FNXC:WorkflowProjections 2026-06-17-08:42:
These tests pin the user-facing workflow status surfaced for a task by projectWorkflowWorkStatus, which
dashboard, API, and CLI all read. Requirements encoded here:
- A single workflow status is derived from a task's work items by priority (recovery > manual-hold >
  running > retrying > merge > other), so the most operator-relevant state wins when several items coexist.
- When no item is still active, the task projects as "complete" from the deterministic earliest succeeded
  item; if there is no workflow item at all it falls back to the "legacy" task status.
- The projected workItemId must be stable for identical logical state regardless of work-item array order,
  so the same task never flips between ids across callers.
