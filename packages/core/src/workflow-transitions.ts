/**
 * Workflow-resolved transition adjacency (U4, R4/R9/R13).
 *
 * `moveTaskInternal` (flag ON) and `board.ts` both derive "which columns can a
 * card move to from here" from the SAME helper so the two surfaces never
 * diverge — `resolveAllowedColumns(ir, fromColumn)`.
 *
 * ── Why an explicit adjacency, not pure graph-derivation ──────────────────────
 *
 * The plan asks: derive allowed column adjacency from node placement + edges,
 * and for the DEFAULT workflow it MUST reproduce `VALID_TRANSITIONS` exactly.
 * Pure graph-edge derivation CANNOT reproduce it: `VALID_TRANSITIONS` encodes
 * backward/reopen edges (in-review → todo, done → todo, archived → done, …) and
 * cross edges (in-progress → done) that have no counterpart in the linear
 * execute → review → merge → end pipeline graph. The IR edges describe the
 * forward automation walk; the column adjacency describes legal *board* moves
 * (drags, reopens, recovery), which is a strictly larger, partly-cyclic set.
 *
 * So per the plan's documented fallback we attach an explicit per-column
 * `transitions` adjacency:
 *   - For the BUILT-IN default workflow we reproduce `VALID_TRANSITIONS` verbatim
 *     (keyed by the legacy column ids, which are exactly the default workflow's
 *     column ids — KTD-1). This is the parity contract the transition-parity
 *     suite machine-checks.
 *   - For CUSTOM workflows (no explicit adjacency authored yet — authoring lands
 *     with the editor in U10) we derive a linear forward+back adjacency from the
 *     declared column ORDER: each column may move to its neighbors (prev/next).
 *     This is a safe, predictable default that keeps every column reachable and
 *     never strands a card; richer custom adjacency is future work.
 *
 * The adjacency is intentionally a column→columns map computed once per IR; it
 * is read-only and pure.
