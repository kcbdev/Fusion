/**
 * Slice 2 (Hybrid Anchoring) goal-context seam for system prompts.

 * This module formats active goals into a compact, deterministic prompt section

 *
 * Truncation is deterministic: goals are re-sorted oldest-first and newer goals
 * are dropped first under cap/budget pressure so longest-standing strategy
 * remains anchored. Wiring this seam into heartbeat/executor prompt assembly is
 * handled separately by FN-5653.
