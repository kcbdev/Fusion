/**
 * ReviewerGate — drives the task-keyed Reviewer verdict run (company-model U6).
 *
 * On a company-model board (flag on + `isCompanyBoardIr`), a task entering the
 * in-review column triggers a Reviewer run executed as the board's Reviewer
 * effective agent. The persisted write-once verdict (in `task_reviewer_runs`,
 * via {@link TaskReviewerStore}) gates the exit from in-review — the gate itself
 * lives in `store.moveTask` (U6 block 2c); this module is the run DRIVER that
 * produces the verdict and handles the fail → backward-move / rework-budget /
 * needs-attention-diagnostic / recovery flows.
 *
 * Reuses the mission Validator's execution shape (read-only AI judge: no code
 * edits, no board task creation) but is task-keyed and self-contained so the
 * mission machinery stays untouched. The assertion evaluation is a pluggable
 * seam (`evaluate`) so:
 *   - production wires an AI-session-backed evaluator (mirrors
 *     MissionExecutionLoop.runValidation — readonly tools, structured-JSON parse);
 *   - tests supply a deterministic stub.
 * When no assertion is explicitly linked, the evaluator derives one lazily from
 * the task description / PROMPT.md (mirroring how mission features lazily link
 * Contract Assertions) — encapsulated in the evaluator.
 *
 * Idempotency: `driveReviewForTask` is a no-op when a run is already in flight
 * for the task or a terminal verdict already exists for the current round. This
 * is what makes the self-healing re-drive safe and the trigger seam's
 * "exactly once" non-critical.
