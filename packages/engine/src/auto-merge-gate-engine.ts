/**
 * Engine-side binding for the core `shouldAutoMergeTask` chokepoint (U7).
 *
 * `@fusion/core`'s {@link shouldAutoMergeTask} is pure: it takes the resolved
 * facts (per-task override, global setting, merge mode, company-board flag,
 * verdict status, manual-approval marker) and returns a routing decision. This
 * module resolves those facts from the engine's stores/resolver and calls the
 * predicate, so engine trigger gates (merger enqueue, self-healing sweeps, the
 * verdict-pass enqueue seam) consult the one chokepoint without re-deriving the
 * facts each.
 *
 * `prMode` is derived from the task's resolved workflow IR: a board whose IR
 * carries any `pr-*` node kind is PR-mode (the unified PR entity drives merge;
 * the legacy queue is never used). `isCompanyBoard` is the company-model flag AND
 * `isCompanyBoardIr`. The verdict status is read from the {@link TaskReviewerStore}
 * (`pass` / `fail` / pending). The manual-approval marker input is FALSE today —
 * the log-based marker was removed as a dead path (the strict matrix forbids the
 * human drag that would write it); manual approval flows through `autoMerge:false`.
