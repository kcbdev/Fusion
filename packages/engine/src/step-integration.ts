/**
 * step-integration — the ordered integration stage for worktree-isolated foreach
 * instances (step-inversion KTD-11, U10).
 *
 * Under `isolation: "worktree"` each foreach step instance runs in its OWN
 * worktree/branch off a common integration base. Completing the instance's
 * sub-walk does NOT mark the step done — instead the instance enqueues here as
 * `awaiting-integration`. The {@link IntegrationQueue} then lands completed
 * branches onto the task's main branch (the integration base) **strictly in step
 * order**: instance `i` integrates only after instances `0..i-1` are integrated
 * or skipped. This is the single place where a worktree-isolated instance's work
 * becomes visible on main history, so:
 *
 *   - **Success**: flip the projection FIRST (`updateStep(..., "done", graph)` —
 *     the dependency-order guard admits it because predecessors are done), THEN
 *     mark the instance row `completed`/`integratedAt` (projection-first ordering,
 *     KTD-7: closes the merge-blocker race), THEN release the instance worktree
 *     (pool hygiene).
 *   - **Conflict**: discard the instance branch (release worktree), and emit
 *     `outcome:integration-conflict` for that instance. The foreach sub-walk
 *     routes that like a rework — re-execute the step on the UPDATED integration
 *     base in a fresh worktree, counting against the instance's `maxReworkCycles`
 *     budget (exhaustion → rework-exhausted as usual).
 *
 * All git mechanics are behind the injectable {@link IntegrationGitOps} so this
 * module is hermetically testable with fakes. Production wires it (executor.ts)
 * to a rebase/cherry-pick onto the task's main branch that reuses merger.ts's
 * conflict-classification helpers (`getConflictedFiles`) for conflict detection —
 * NOT reimplemented here.
 *
 * Reconcile alignment (KTD-11): `complete step N` commits live on instance
 * branches before integration and on main history after it; the projection rule
 * ("done iff integrated") therefore agrees with `reconcileStepsFromGitHistory`
 * (which reads main-worktree history) by construction.
