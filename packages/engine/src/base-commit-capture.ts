/**
 * Resolve the fork-point base SHA for a freshly acquired task worktree.
 *
 * Called immediately after worktree acquisition, when the task branch was
 * just created/force-reset from the local integration branch
 * (`prepareForTask` forks from local `main` via `resolveIntegrationBranch`).
 *
 * The merge-base MUST be measured against LOCAL main first (origin/main only
 * as a fallback), matching the contamination-base sites in
 * `worktree-acquisition.ts` and `auto-recovery-handlers/branch-worktree.ts`.
 * The merger lands tasks on local main before pushing, so at fork time local
 * main can be ahead of origin/main by merged-but-unpushed commits. Measuring
 * against origin/main rewinds the base past those commits; once the
 * post-merge rebase-and-push rewrites their SHAs, `baseCommitSha..HEAD`
 * permanently sweeps the predecessors' files into this task's diff (FN-5937:
 * in-review tasks showing 31 "files changed" instead of 12).
 *
 * Returns `undefined` only when every git invocation fails (caller treats a
 * missing base as non-fatal).
 *
 * FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-21-20:10:
 * `integrationBranch` is an OPTIONAL TRAILING param defaulting to the historic
 * "main" literal so the single-repo executor caller and the real-git tests stay
 * green without change. Workspace mode (U2/KTD3) passes each sub-repo's RESOLVED
 * integration branch so per-repo base capture forks against the right branch
 * instead of a hardcoded "main". The local-first ordering (merge-base HEAD
 * <local> then origin/<branch>) is preserved per-branch to keep the
 * inflation-prevention invariant (FN-5937) intact for non-main integration
 * branches too.
