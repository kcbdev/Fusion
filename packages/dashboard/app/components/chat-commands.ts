/**
 * Generic slash-command registry for chat composers.
 *
 * This module is deliberately small and additive: it defines the shape of a
 * dispatchable chat command and a starter registry containing exactly one
 * entry (`/steer`). Adding the next command (e.g. `/retry`) is a matter of
 * appending another `ChatCommand` entry — no changes to the matching/
 * filtering helpers below are required.
 *
 * The registry is consumed by composer hosts (e.g. ChatView.tsx,
 * TaskPlannerChatTab.tsx) which own:
 *   - trigger detection / menu rendering (reusing the existing "/" trigger
 *     scaffolding already used for skill autocomplete), and
 *   - dispatch-on-submit (deciding whether the current composer text
 *     matches a registered command and, if so, calling `run()` instead of
 *     sending a normal chat message).
 *
 * `/steer` specifically requires a bound task with a running/active agent;
 * callers are responsible for gating dispatch on that (this module has no
 * opinion on task/agent state — it only matches text and executes actions).
