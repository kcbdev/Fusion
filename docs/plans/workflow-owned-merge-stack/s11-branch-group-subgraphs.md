# S11: branch group workflow subgraphs

## Stack Role

This PR delivers the S11 slice in the workflow-owned merge, retry, scheduling,
and recovery migration stack. It ships the decision logic and tests for
branch-group member integration and group promotion.

## Milestone

Branch Groups

## Depends On

S6 merge capabilities, S8 merge processing, and S10 recovery events.

## Goal

Move branch-group member integration and group promotion into workflow-owned merge subgraphs.

## Expected File Scope

group merge coordinator, merge trait, integration worktree, built-in IR, shared branch-group workflow tests.

## Expected Tests

Member integration with autoMerge exception, blocked group promotion, conflict routing, final promotion guards.

## Exit Gate

Branch-group coordinator no longer owns task lifecycle independent of workflow runtime.

## Full Plan

See `docs/plans/2026-06-09-003-refactor-workflow-owned-merge-full-migration-slices-plan.md`.
