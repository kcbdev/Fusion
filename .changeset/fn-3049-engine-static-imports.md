"@runfusion/fusion": patch

Replace dashboard runtime dynamic `@fusion/engine` imports with bundler-safe static imports and add regression coverage to prevent reintroduction. This avoids npm-installed runtime failures caused by non-static engine imports that cannot be safely inlined during bundling.
