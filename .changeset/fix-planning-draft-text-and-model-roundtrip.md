Fix planning draft sessions losing the user's typed text and model selection between draft create, sidebar reopen, and Start Planning. The agent now receives the freshest persisted `initialPlan` (not the truncated cache from when the draft was first auto-created), drafts that survive a backend restart can still be started, and the model override the user picked at draft time is restored when reopening from the sidebar and threaded through summarize. The sidebar shows the summarized title once available and falls back to a per-draft preview derived from `inputPayload` while the title is still the placeholder — so multiple drafts are distinguishable without leaking raw keystrokes into the persisted title. Titles get re-summarized on textarea blur and modal close so they reflect the final text rather than locking to the first blur snapshot, and the start path skips its own summarize when blur/close already produced a title for the same final text.
