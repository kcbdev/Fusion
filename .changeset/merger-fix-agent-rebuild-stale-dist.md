Improve merger verification-fix agent: detect stale/missing sibling-workspace `dist/` artifacts (e.g. `Failed to resolve import "./X.js"`, `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` into another package) and rebuild before assuming a code fix is needed. The agent may also modify files unrelated to the task's original change when needed to make pre-existing build/test breakage on the base branch pass.
